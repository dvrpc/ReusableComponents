# Story map template


## Includes
    - modal to house text/img content with built-in navigation
    - set of functions and config objects associating modal "scene" and map effects (layers, zoom, etc)
    - easily append or update map sources and layers

## Getting Started
    - copy folder as root (or folder contents into root) of project folder
    - spin up a local server (live server plugin if using vscode)
    - that's it. Mapbox is the only external source, everything else is vanilla. The rest of the content and styles are up to you. Happy hacking.

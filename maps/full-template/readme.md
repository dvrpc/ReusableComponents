# Standard, responsive webmap template


## Includes
    - about modal (add tabs by pulling code from tabs folder)
    - DVRPC extent map overlay to easily re-orient view to the DVRPC region
    - easily append or update map sources and layers

## Getting Started
    - copy folder as root (or folder contents into root) of project folder
    - spin up a local server (live server plugin if using vscode)
    - that's it. Mapbox is the only external source, everything else is vanilla. The rest of the content and styles are up to you. Happy hacking. 

## TODO
    - create onchange fncs for all form elements (select, radio, checkbox, etc)
        - toggles layer visibility
        - updates legend item (toggle in case of radio, replace in case of others)
    - save working demo
